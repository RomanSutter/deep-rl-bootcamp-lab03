# deep-rl-bootcamp-lab03
Lab 3 of the Deep RL bootcamp from MIT


Task 1 & 2 Implemented
Task 3 not able to complete due to setup issues involving the Prelab Setup and Lab 3 Setup


## Alternative Solution
#### Based on the Repository [https://github.com/sagerpascal/deep-rl-bootcamp-lab3](https://github.com/sagerpascal/deep-rl-bootcamp-lab3)
Since it was not possible to get the implementation running on the current setup, the following results are based on the solution from Pascal Sager with additional Research.
